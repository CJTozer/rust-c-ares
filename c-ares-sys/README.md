Bindings for [`c-ares`](http://c-ares.haxx.se/), autogenerated by [`rust-bindgen`](https://github.com/crabtw/rust-bindgen):

    bindgen -l cares -match ares -o src/ffi.rs /usr/include/ares.h

... and then remove `ares_fds` and `ares_process`.  (These both use `fd_set`.  Cursory search didn't find an existing Rust representation of this structure and since I don't intend to use either of those functions in the high-level API, it's simplest just to pretend they're not there).
